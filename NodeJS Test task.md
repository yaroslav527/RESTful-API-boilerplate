# Node.js Test Task

## Technical Requirements

Implement a RESTful API using Node.js with the following requirements: 

1. Create an endpoint to retrieve a list of users. The response should include the user's ID, name, and email. 
2. Create an endpoint to retrieve a single user by ID. The response should include the user's ID, name, and email. 
3. Create an endpoint to create a new user. The request should include the user's name and email. Validate the input data and return an appropriate response. 
4. Create an endpoint to update an existing user by ID. The request should include the user's ID, name, and email. Validate the input data and return an appropriate response. 
5. Create an endpoint to delete a user by ID. Return an appropriate response indicating the success or failure of the operation.

**Note:** You can use any framework and database of your choice to store and retrieve user data.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Implementation of the RESTful API according to the given requirements.
- JavaScript or TypeScript is used as the development language.
- Proper error handling and validation of input data.
- Special attention should be paid to the following points:
	- The code should be written clearly and neatly, observing tabulation and other writing elements, without unnecessary elements and functions that are not relevant to the functionality, provided with clear comments, if necessary.
	- Readability and the existence of elementary architecture.
	- Cleanness and formatting of the code is an equally important factor. The code should be written in a unified style. 
	- Absence of copypaste and duplication of logic.
	- The project should use code linters for static code analysis.

## Deliverables

- Share the code for the RESTful API implementation via a GitHub repository or an archived file.
